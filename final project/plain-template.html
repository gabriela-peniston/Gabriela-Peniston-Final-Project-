<h2>
  Puerto Rico's population keeps decreasing due to people moving out of the island, and it's only getting worse by the years.

<strong>San Juan, Puerto Rico- </strong> Throughout most its existence, Puerto Rico’s population has struggled to maintain its stability. According to the US Census Bureau, Puerto Rico’s population decreased by 11.8% in between the years 2010 and 2020, going from 3.7 million citizens to 3.2 million. The decline is a result of a combination of factors including a collapsing power grid, high unemployment rates, and back-to-back natural disasters that make it difficult for the island to regain strength. The trend has raised concerns about the future of the island’s economy as well as the well-being of the people.</div>
</p>


<p>
The situation began to arise mainly due to a series of natural disasters, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/weather/hurricane-maria">Hurricane María</a> in 2017 that devastated the island by leaving a widespread of damage and forced many to leave the island and look for better living arrangements. The storm knocked out power to almost the entire island and caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructures. Even five years after the hurricane, the island’s recovery is still an ongoing issue, and many residents still find themselves with the lack of basic services such as access to electricity and water. The lack of resources and attention the damages were getting from the government caused many residents to move to the United States and leave everything behind right after the hurricane, causing a drastic decrease in population around this time. 
</p>


<p>
“I noticed that year that a lot of students and their families moved to the U.S. Some to areas in Florida, some to Boston, some to New York. So, there was a lot of displacement,” Syracuse University Director of Global Partnerships <a href="https://nyc.syr.edu/about/staff/lubin-house-admissions/silva-amparo.html"> Sofía Amparo Silva</a> said during an interview. “The political issues, which were damaging completely in Puerto Rico, and then the earthquakes and more natural disasters…it’s been really rough for a long time even before 2017. But it has been very challenging.”
</p>

<p>
One of the main reasons why citizens are moving out of the island is the economic situation. According to a VOA News article on the migration of Puerto Ricans, residents leave the island in order to achieve economic stability. The economic situation has been a major concern for quite some time and now it has influenced residents to leave the island in search for more stable jobs as well as lower costs of living.
</p>



<p>
“People who were very successful in Puerto Rico had to come and be in the U.S and sort of find their way again entirely, adjusting to a whole new environment, get new jobs, and in situations get jobs where the financial security wasn’t there for a lot of people. For most people, they had lost everything they had in Puerto Rico. Property, cars, family in certain situations. So, if they stayed, they had to redo everything. But if they left, they also left without those resources,” said by Sofía Amparo Silva.
</p>


<p>
Those who stayed on the island still struggle as the cost of living continues to rise and job opportunities become rarer with each passing day. Particularly in the rural areas of Puerto Rico, residents have grown frustrated to see that their government has not done enough to fix these economic challenges and have also realized that their lives and opinions are being disregarded.

As the map above shows, the decline of population is most prominent in rural areas in the east and south of Puerto Rico that are farther away from the metropolitan region. The population decline has been significantly greater in these areas due to the lack of job opportunities and the high poverty rates, influencing many citizens to leave for the mainland in search for better opportunities. 
</p>


<p>
The southern and eastern areas of Puerto Rico were the most affected by Hurricane María due to how close they are to the coastal regions. Being further away from the metropolitan area caused recovery efforts to be slower and left many residents without the resources that they needed. 
</p>

<p>
The lack of access to healthcare, education, and other essential services has also contributed to the population decrease, many residents finding it difficult to maintain their families on the island. Many of the island’s resources, such as healthcare and schools, have been underfunded which makes it difficult for many people to receive proper medical attention and high-quality education.
</p>


<p>
Political uncertainty also plays a role in the population decline. The island has struggled many generations to try to find a stable political status, either becoming a state, remaining a territory, or seeking independence from the United States. This lack of clarity and instability has made it difficult for businesses, investors, and residents to make long-term plans for the future.
</p>


<p>
According to research published by the Washington Post as well as a meeting between the United Nations, many Puerto Ricans feel that the lack of progress in the island’s political status prevents it from reaching its full potential. This leads many citizens to move to somewhere different that provides them with the sense of political resolution and certainty.

Recent data released by the United States Census Bureau shows the difference between Puerto Rico’s population in 2010 versus 2020, revealing a significant change. According to the graph, Puerto Rico’s population dropped from 3.7 million to 3.3, a decrease of roughly 439,915 residents.  
</p>


<p>
This population decline is expected to have an impact on the already struggling economy. With fewer residents on the island, there are less people to work and buy goods, leading to a decline in demand. Hence, a decrease in economic activity due to businesses heavily relying on the local consumers who keep leaving, putting many retails owners with nothing to pay their bills with. 
</p>

<p>
Less people on the island means that there are less people paying government taxes. This will then have a direct effect on the residents currently living there, influencing the government into increasing taxes at the same time as the cost of living is at all-time high, a pattern that will just continue pushing Puerto Ricans out of the island. 
</p>

<p>
This trend is expected to continue in the upcoming years, with many experts predicting that Puerto Rico’s population could drop below 3 million by the end of the decade, according to the United States Census Bureau. 
</p>


<p>
The population decline in Puerto Rico is a cause for concern considering that it has a significant impact on the island’s social and economic well-being. As Puerto Rico continues to struggle with the effects of the economic crisis, natural disasters,  and the political status, it remains unclear what the future holds for these residents and island itself.
